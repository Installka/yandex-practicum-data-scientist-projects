# Module project 1

__Client__ - computer games online store.

__Input data__ - historical game sales data, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation).

__What's done__:
- data preprocessing;
- relevant time period for determining sales strategy for 2017 was found;
- the average life cycle of the platform was determined;
- the period of emergence of new generations of platforms was determined;
- potentially profitable platforms for 2017, as well as platforms worth focusing on selling were determined;
- the most relevant platforms and genres in general as well as for different markets were determined;
- on the basis of the analysis of the relationship between the ratings of critics/users and sales of games it was concluded that user ratings practically do not affect sales, but the ratings of critics should be taken into account;
- the relationship between game sales and ESRB rating was analyzed;
- the hypothesis that the average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same was tested and rejected;
- the hypothesis that the average user ratings of the Action and Sports genres differ was tested and rejected.

__Tools used__ - pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, SciPy.
