# Introduction to machine learning

__Tariff recommendation__

__Client__ - federal mobile operator.

__Input data__ - data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these tariffs (from the project 3).

__Target__ - build a model for the classification problem, which will choose the appropriate tariff.

__What's done__:
- data splitting to independent and target features;
- data splitting to training, validation and test samples;
- 3 machine learing models fitted and compared (with self-made hyperparameters variation):
    - logistic regression;
    - decision tree;
    - random forest.
- best model tested on test sample and tested for adequacy;
- accuracy on test sample - 0.82.

__Tools used__ - pandas, scikit-learn.
__Models used__ - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier.
