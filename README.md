# yandex-practicum-data-scientist-projects
Projects from [Yandex.Practicum Data Scientist course](https://practicum.yandex.ru/data-scientist/). 
 
Unfortunately, I canâ€™t post datasets from most of the projects here because of limitations in the [Yandex.Practicum terms of use](https://yandex.ru/legal/praktikum_termsofuse/) (clause 4.1). But in some cases datasets were pulled from open sources (project 6), so you can download data and notebook and fully run it.
